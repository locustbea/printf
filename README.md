PrintF Project by Onifade Olalekan and Chidi Amadi

This project is about creating a _ _printf_ function that performs the same tasks as the standard printf function in C language.

Mandatory Tasks:

Task 0:
	We are required to write a fucnction that produces output to a format. The prototype to be used is "int _printf(const char *format, ...);" and the fucntion returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings. We are required to handle only three conversion specifiers, which are: c, s, and %. We are not required to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function. We do not need to handle flag characters, field width, precision, and length modifiers.


Task 1:
	We are tasked with handling the following conversion specifiers: d and i. Just like in Task 0, we do not need to handle flag characters, field width, precision, and length modifiers.
